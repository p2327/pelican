Today we are going to work on a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). We'll use this example to look at some aspects of data cleaning, feature engineerign and model tuning for predictive analysis.

*TODO*

```python
# Test pygment.css
def abc():
    for a in a:
        if a == b:
            print(c)
    return None
```
